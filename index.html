    <h2 class="italic">My Sister's Funeral</h2>
    <h6>Gerald Stern, 1925</h6>
    <p>Since there was no mother for the peach tree we did it all<br>
alone, which made the two of us closer<br>
though closeness brought its loneliness, and it would<br>
have been better I think sometimes to be sterile<br>
from the start just to avoid the pain<br>
which in my life this far has lasted seventy<br>
years for I am in love with a skeleton<br>
on whose small bones a dress hung for a while,<br>
on whose small skull a bit of curly hair<br>
was strung, and what is dust I still don’t know<br>
since there was no mother to turn to then and ask<br>
what else was she wearing, did she have on shoes,<br>
and were the two trees from Georgia, and was it<br>
true somebody said the other peach<br>
should have died instead of her; and I could<br>
imagine the nose going first though forty years later<br>
the trees were still there and not as big as you’d think;<br>
and it was my cousin Red with the flabby lips<br>
who said it, he had red eyes, a red monstrosity,<br>
a flabby body, half the house was filled with<br>
male cousins, they were born in rooms a<br>
short distance from the rats, I can’t remember<br>
which ones had the accents nor what his<br>
Hebrew name was, nor his English.<br>

    <h2 class="italic">Nothing was ever what it claimed to be</h2>
    <h6>Karen Volkman</h6>
    <p>Nothing was ever what it claimed to be,<br>
the earth, blue egg, in its seeping shell<br>
dispensing damage like a hollow hell<br>
inchling weeping for a minor sea<br>
<br>
ticking its tidelets, x and y and z.<br>
The blue beneficence we call and spell<br>
and call blue heaven, the whiteblue well<br>
of constant water, deepening a thee,<br>
<br>
a thou and who, touching every what—<br>
and in the or, a shudder in the cut—<br>
and that you are, blue mirror, only stare<br>
<br>
bluest blankness, whether in the where,<br>
sheen that bleeds blue beauty we are taught<br>
drowns and booms and vowels.  I will not.<br>
